                <h2><strong>ENGAGE.</strong> Our revolutionary literacy and language learning platform.</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="text-left">Engage is an education platform for self-directed literacy learning that uses advanced pedagogical research, the latest music videos and cutting edge technology. We built it in collaboration with Head Teachers, literacy specialists and children in UK schools and it is mapped onto The New Curriculum.. Engage is an intelligent supplementary tool for SPAG literacy teaching and is personalised for each child, allowing them to progress at their own pace while automatically assessing their progress. It uses advanced pedagogical research, cutting edge technology, games and the latest music videos, making learning fun and engaging.</p>
                
                <p class="text-left">Engage turns literacy learning of the SPAG part of the New Curriculum into interactive games, allowing students to learn faster while watching content that they already love. Subtitled song videos are uniquely placed to help reading - students see and hear familiar words at the same time; song-based games are naturally divided into short, manageable chunks of three to four minutes; students are encouraged to repeat exercises, increasing exposure to written and spoken language.</p>
                
                <p class="text-left">
                    We believe that:
                    <ul class="text-left list-group">
                        <li>We learn fastest when there is a real reason to do so</li>
                        <li>Language learning can thrive outside the classroom and support teachers</li>
                        <li>Engaging students’ interests and imagination is key</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="text-left">To our knowledge, there is no other learning tool that supports all these activities as an integrated process. Engage adapts the material that students choose to engage with out of interest - thus, the content that people are motivated to engage with anyway is exploited for language learning. In the future, Engage will be able to use any video content for language learning, meaning that films, interviews and even football commentary could become tools for teaching children about spelling, punctuation and grammar.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center"><strong>FOR TEACHERS</strong></h2>
            <br>
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>Engage is mapped onto the New Curriculum, covering every SPAG topic that teachers are required to cover. It uses appropriate music videos, overlaid with automatically generated, graded and updated exercises that address the required topics in grammar and spelling. Our educational platform is web-based, so children will only need access to a computer to use it, although it can also be accessed using tablets or smartphones. All videos are pre-screened for bad language and slang, as well as for visual suitability to ensure that all material is appropriate for schools.</p>

            <h3>How we built Engage?</h3>
            <p>We began by winning funding support to design Engage from the government-backed SBRI (https://sbri.innovateuk.org/about-sbri) as part of their Learning: Design For Impact initiative, which seeks to bring together innovation in UK research and technology with schools to impact on key social issues. When we first decided to create Engage, we knew that the process had to start with the people who matter - teachers and students - and that they needed to be the ones telling us what they needed. We also wanted to gain a thorough understanding of how schools decide which apps they want to use and how they feel best supported by companies when they have particular customer service needs.</p>

            <p>We therefore began by interviewing Head Teachers, literacy coordinators and teaching staff in 6 schools around the UK with different populations, and we asked them to partner with us in creating something meaningful and useful. Some schools had populations of predominantly EAL children and others had predominantly white British pupils. Schools also varied greatly in the levels of social deprivation that their pupils experienced, and we made sure that we worked with some schools in areas of extreme social deprivation because we wanted to create something meaningful to help these schools and their pupils.</p>

            <p>We asked the Head Teachers and staff in detail about the problems they encountered, their frustrations and what they really needed to make their lives easier and to help their pupils learn. We asked them to tell us what their ideal app would do for them and how it would help them in their day to day work.</p>

            <p>Our lead researcher then looked at all the transcripts and elicited common themes, to come up with a list of problems and wishes for ideal teaching aids, as specified by teaching staff. From this list, we began to design and build Engage.</p>

            <p>When we had designed an initial version Engage, we went back to the schools to check that we had understood what they needed and designed something to meet those needs.</p>

            <p>We then built the first working version of Engage and tested it with our partner schools in a pilot trial to see if Year 5 and Year 6 children enjoyed using it and whether the teachers experienced Engage as a useful teaching aid. We interviewed the staff again, gaining qualitative feedback from them about the positives and negatives, and we asked them to report back what the children had said about it.</p>

            <h3>How will Engage help you?</h3>
            <p>Engage is designed to help teachers in several ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>We have a huge database of appropriate music video content that can be used to teach children the SPAG topics that you need to cover. Therefore, you don’t need to constantly search for interesting content to use as a teaching aid.</li>
                    <li>Different songs are chosen and all exercises are automatically created by us, so you don’t have to spend valuable time creating exercises.</li>
                    <li>We’ve already done the work of mapping all the required SPAG topics in the New Curriculum into our system, so Engage covers everything you need to teach.</li>
                    <li>Engage puts the fun into learning for children, creating games and exercises that help children to learn topics and the relevant grammatical vocabulary that they weill need for their SAT tests. Language is taught in context, with a focus on helping children to apply their knowledge, and all while having fun.</li>
                    <li>Because exercise creation is automatic, you can allocate different exercises to different individuals, groups or classes, ensuring that every child can easily learn at their own pace and that it’s no longer a problem to have children at different levels within one class group.</li>
                    <li>You can see how children are progressing (both as an overview and for specific games/topics) and also how much they engage with the games, as Engage provides you with detailed but easy-to-read data analytics.</li>
                    <li>Engage can therefore help with assessment as it provides measurable evidence of improvement</li>
                </ul>
